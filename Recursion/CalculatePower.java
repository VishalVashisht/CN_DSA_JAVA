/*
Calculate Power

Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.
Do this recursively.
Input format :
Two integers x and n (separated by space)
Output Format :
x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)
Constraints :
0 <= x <= 30
0 <= n <= 30
Sample Input 1 :
 3 4
Sample Output 1 :
81
Sample Input 2 :
 2 5
Sample Output 2 :
32
